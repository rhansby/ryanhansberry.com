        This past weekend, two friends and I attended <a href="http://lahacks.com/">LA Hacks</a>, and created an application
        that uses the <a href="https://www.leapmotion.com/">Leap Motion</a> to control first-person shooter games, like <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/css">Counter Strike</a>.
        We called it Leap Gamepad.
    </p>

    <p>
        Below is a demo video of Leap Gamepad in action:

    </p>

    <p>
        We used a Leap Motion and its JavaScript SDK to build the application in Node.js. The application is essentially a local
        Node server that listens for Leap data, interprets and analyzes it, and synthesizes raw mouse and keyboard events in the
        host operating system to control the running FPS game.

        The most difficult part of the project was getting everything working together initially -- all three of us feared
        that Leap data might be janky, that Node would not be performant enough to handle this task, or that we would not be able
        to sufficiently emulate operating system events. However, Leap Motion data proved to be surprisingly good, Node kept up, and
        with the help of the excellent <a href="https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs">robot.js</a> we could emulate mouse events. We created
        a working prototype within the first 12 to 14 hours of LA Hacks.

        The video below shows our first buggy prototype. You may notice it doesn't pick up a lot of "trigger pulls."
    </p>

    </div>

    <p>
        We spent the rest of our time fine tuning the prototype -- removing mouse jitter, making gesture recognition consistent,
        and removing bugs. Ultimately, we ended with a finely tuned product with a few, but great features.
    </p>

    <p>
        This ended up being my favorite hackathon because 1) we ended up with a solid project that works robustly, and 2)
        we got a great response from other people. Many people came up to us while we were working to play with it, and our table
        was consistently swarmed during demo time (unfortunately I didn't take any pictures).
