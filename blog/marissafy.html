        This past weekend, close to a hundred interns from various companies (myself included) visited Yahoo's headquarters
        in Sunnyvale for the Y! Intern Hackathon. My teammates and I ended up building a super-awesome, totally-serious web app.

        You can find the website <a href="http://marissafy.herokuapp.com">here</a>. Make sure you have a photo with (a) face(s)!

    <!--p>
        Talking points: using heroku, the stack, face recognition, the website crashed when we got too many requests :D
