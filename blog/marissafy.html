    <h3>Marissafy - A Yahoo! Hackathon Project</h3>

    <p>
        This past weekend, close to a hundred interns from various companies (myself included) visited Yahoo's headquarters
        in Sunnyvale for the Y! Intern Hackathon. My teammates and I ended up building a super-awesome, totally-serious web app.
    </p>

    <p>
        We ended up seeing hundreds of Yahoo! employees visit the site, and even got several submissions to
        <a href="http://marissafy.tumblr.com">our tumblr.</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        You can find the original hack <a href="http://marissafy.herokuapp.com">here</a>.
        A new, refactored version of this app can be found <a href="http://marissafy.ryanhansberry.com">here</a>.
        Make sure you have a photo with one or more faces!
    </p>

    <h4 class="section-header">The Original Hack</h4>

    <p>
        We all learned a lot from hacking this thing together. Personally, it was my first time working with
        <a href="http://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a>, <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Service (AWS)</a>,
        and the <a href="http://api.imgur.com/">Imgur API</a>. I also learned learned a bit more about HTML5's
        Canvas along the way.
    </a>

    <p>
        In order to implement the face recognition component of the app, we found that a C++ library, <a href="http://opencv.org/">OpenCV</a>,
        was supposedly the most accurate. We needed a server that would allow us to run a C++ program: we decided to use AWS.
        We decided that we didn't want the AWS server to also have to deal with serving the app, so we let Heroku handle that part.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thus, the original hack works as so: the user uploads a photo; the Heroku server relays the photo to AWS; the web service
        calculates and returns the coordinates and dimensions of the faces in the photo; Heroku relays this information to the client;
        and finally, client JavaScript, via Canvas, pastes Marissa's face wherever it's been told to.
    </p>

    <p>
        Initially, we were all proud of having been able to maneuver such a large stack in such a short time. But, on second thought,
        I personally feel that this was a bad case of over-engineering. I think we got caught up in thinking we needed to use OpenCV,
        as opposed to an <a href="http://liuliu.me/ccv/js/nss/">entirely client-based face recognition library</a>.
        On top of that, even if OpenCV proved necessary, perhaps we should have kept things simpler and served the app
        directly from AWS, so we would have to deal with just one server.
    </p>

    <p>
        I did still learn a great deal: Heroku did prove to be awesome at getting an app up and running really quickly; I discovered
        that Canvas is great at compositing images, and makes it really easy to create a "screenshot" of itself; and was pleasantly surprised
        at how easy it was to put such an image online with the Imgur API.
    </p>

    <h4 class="section-header">The New, Refactored Hack</h4>

    <p>
        I felt uncomfortable with the convoluted stack we had created, and also unsure about its stability. The Heroku instance,
        in particular, bothered me. When a free Heroku instance is not visited after a certain amount of time, it essentially goes to
        sleep, and wakes up when it's next visited. However, I've observed this "wake up" take a <em>long time</em>, so long that it
        might seem to have crashed or 404'd.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thus, I decided to scrap OpenCV in favor of a <a href="http://liuliu.me/ccv/js/nss/">client-side face-recognition library</a>,
        and used a <a href="http://facedetection.jaysalvat.com/">jQuery wrapper for it</a>. I also moved the app to a
        personal web server of mine, so I wouldn't have to worry about Heroku's perceived performance inconsistency. These two changes
        meant less software and less hardware to maintain (awesome!). I now only had to think about client-side programming.
        The changes also made for a faster app (more awesome!).
    </p>

    <h4 class="section-header">Final Thoughts</h4>

    <p>
        I was really proud of the original hack, but perhaps didn't want to admit that it may have been over-engineered.
    </p>

    <p>
        I think it's important that we be able to look back at our past work and be proud of it, but still analyze it
        with a critical eye, and I'm glad that I was able to do so, to some extent.
