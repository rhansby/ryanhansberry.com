        I've been wanting to use <a href="http://threejs.org">Three.js</a> for the past few months, so when I had
        some free time this past weekend, I decided to make a small graphics demo with it.
    </p>

    <p>
        <a href="/portfolio/solar-system.html">You can find the demo here.</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        I had previously worked on a solar system demo, in C++ with OpenGL, and had to write fairly long shaders
        to handle transformations and light. Writing this demo using an existing graphics engine was considerably
        more enjoyable, mostly because it completely eliminated the need to fiddle with shaders. Writing in JavaScript
        also allowed me to quickly hack out ideas much faster than would have been possible in C++.
    </p>

    <p>
        Writing this demo in the "realm" of HTML and JavaScript also allowed me to easily create a clean and
        decent looking interface, allowing for the Controls section that you can find below the canvas, and also allowed
        for really simple mouse tracking.
    </p>

    <p>
        In short, the WebGL + Three.js world has caused me significantly less wailing and gnashing of teeth than I'm accustomed to.
        I'm really excited to see what new project I'll work on with it.
