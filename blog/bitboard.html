    <h3>BitBoard: A Web App for Collaborative Drawing</h3>

    <h4 class="section-header">Background</h4>

    <p>
        BitBoard is a collaborative "digital whiteboard" web application that combines the advantages of the visual real estate
        of computer monitors and the fidelity of mobile device touch input. In short, BitBoard allows
        teams to collaboratively draw on a digital canvas on any device.

        or <a href="https://github.com/CS130-BitBoard/BitBoard">check out the github page</a>.

        Below is a demo video of BitBoard in action:

    <p>
        BitBoard was developed as a quarter-long project for the CS130 (Software Engineering) course at UCLA, in Spring Quarter 2015.
        My partners and I are all proud of the resulting project, and I wanted to discuss the application featues which I think are the most unique,
        and that I think would be useful in other tools.
    </p>

    <h4 class="section-header">Unique Features</h4>

    <p>
        My favorite feature (which I implemented) is being able to see the screen bounds of a mobile user on a desktop view
        (notice that the iPhone's screen bounds are overlaid on the left desktop's view):
    </p>

    <div class="video-wrapper">
        <video autoplay muted loop>
            <source src="bitboard/bounds.webm">
            <source src="bitboard/bounds.mp4">
        </video>
    </div>

    <p>
        Another cool feature is BitBoard's boards' "infinite" nature; if a user draws close to a board's boundaries,
        the board will dynamically resize:
    </p>

    <div class="video-wrapper">
        <video autoplay muted loop>
            <source src="bitboard/dynamic.webm">
            <source src="bitboard/dynamic.mp4">
        </video>
    </div>

    <p>
        (This feature does display some small aberrations but for the most part works fairly well)
    </p>

    <h4 class="section-header">Final Thoughts</h4>

    <p>
        BitBoard was one of my last (and largest) projects at UCLA, and I believe one of my best.
        I of course want to also acknowledge my project partners' hard work in the course of creating this game.
        You can find their names on the <a href="https://github.com/CS130-BitBoard/BitBoard">Github page</a>.
