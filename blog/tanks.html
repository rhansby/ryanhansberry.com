    <h3>Creating a 3D Multiplayer Game in WebGL</h3>

    <p>
        Over the past month I and a few classmates have worked on our final project for our upper division
        3D graphics course at UCLA. We chose to make a multiplayer game in WebGL, where players can compete
        against each other as tanks.
    </p>

    <p>
        You (and friends) can play this game <a href="http://tanks.purpleoctopus.net">here</a>,
        or check out the <a href="https://github.com/pcrumm/tank-project">github page</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        My classmates and I were all pretty proud of getting a relatively feature-complete project like this
        done in just over three weeks, so I wanted to expand a bit on the game's features and what I myself worked on.
