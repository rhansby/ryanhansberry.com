    <h3>Hi, I'm Ryan :)</h3>
    <hr>

    <p>
        Iâ€™m currently an undergraduate studying at the <a href="http://www.ucla.edu/">University of California,
        Los Angeles (UCLA)</a>, getting my degree in Computer Science, and expect to graduate in 2015. This summer, I
        worked with <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Sports</a> as a software engineering intern.
    </p>

    <p>
        I live in Los Angeles most of the year, but occasionally visit my family in Seattle.
        In my down time, I like to code, read, or <a href="http://www.reddit.com/">procrastinate</a>.
        When I'm feeling a bit more active, I love to bike, or explore LA with my camera.

        I like to use this site as a chance for people to get to know me a little better; you can find my work history
        <a href="work.html">here</a>, and I also write about my recent projects and thoughts <a href="blog.html">on my blog</a>.
