    <h3>Hi, I'm Ryan :)</h3>
    <hr>

    <p>
        Iâ€™m currently an undergraduate studying at the <a href="http://www.ucla.edu/">University of California,
        Los Angeles (UCLA)</a>, getting my degree in Computer Science, and expect to graduate in 2015.
    </p>

    <p>
        In my free time, I like to code, weightlift, bike, read, or explore LA with my camera.
    </p>

    <p>
        I like to use this site as a chance for people to get to know me a little better; you can find my work history
        <a href="resume.html">here</a>, and I also write about my recent projects and thoughts <a href="blog.html">on my blog</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        My twitter handle is <a href="https://twitter.com/rhansby">rhansby</a> and I can be reached at
        <a href="mailto:rhansby@gmail.com">rhansby@gmail.com</a>.
        You can also find me on <a href="https://github.com/rhansby">Github</a>.
