        This summer, I will be interning at <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo!</a> as a front-end web
        development intern, in Santa Monica, CA.
    </p>
    <p>
        I previously worked at <a href="http://www.starbucks.com/">Starbucks</a>, as a programming and IT intern,
        in the summer of 2012, where I worked on the Starbucks mobile app's API, and helped Starbucks partners at
        the walk-in help desk.

        Nowadays, when I'm not too swamped with coursework, I work at a local startup, where I work primarily in HTML, CSS,
        and jQuery, and dabble in the Ruby on Rails backend.
