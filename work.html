        This summer, I worked at <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Sports</a>, as a software engineering intern,
        in Santa Monica, CA. I worked on the frontend, and most notably played a large role in the recent redesign of the website.

        I have previously worked at <a href="http://www.starbucks.com/">Starbucks HQ</a>, as a programming and IT intern,
        where I worked on the Starbucks mobile app's API, and helped Starbucks partners at the walk-in corporate help desk.
