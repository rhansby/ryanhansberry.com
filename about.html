    <p>
        I’m currently an undergraduate studying at the University of California, Los Angeles,
        getting my degree in Computer Science, and expect to graduate in 2015.
    </p>

    <p>
        I’ve always loved doing computer-related things, and especially enjoy programming.
        My most recent programming fixation is in web development, both front-end and back-end.
    </p>

    <p>
        I live in Los Angeles most of the year, but during the summer, I live in Seattle with my family.
        Much of my free time is spent with my friends and my girlfriend. When I’m without such merry company,
        I like to read, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/">procrastinate</a>, listen to music, and occasionally play
        video games. I'm trying in vain to learn ukelele. I’ve also recently taken up the small hobby of urban exploration,
        especially of exploring rooftops.
