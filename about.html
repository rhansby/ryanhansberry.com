    <p>
        I’m currently an undergraduate studying at the University of California, Los Angeles,
        getting my degree in Computer Science, and expect to graduate in 2015.
    </p>

    <p>
        I’ve always loved doing computer-related things, and especially enjoy programming.
        My most recent programming fixation is in web development, both front-end and back-end.
    </p>

    <p>
        I live in Los Angeles most of the year, but occasionally visit my family in Seattle.
        In my down time, I like to code, read, or <a href="http://www.reddit.com/">procrastinate</a>.
        When I'm feeling a bit more active, I love to bike, or explore LA with my camera.
